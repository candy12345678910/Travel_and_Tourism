    details:"Shimla, the capital of the northern state of Himachal Pradesh, which borders Punjab, is India’s largest and best known hill station. It spans a 12km ridge in the foothills of the Himalayas, with steep, forested slopes falling away below and mountain views above. Thanks to its elevation, at over 2,000m, Shimla has always welcomed visitors escaping the soaring temperatures of the plains below, and today grateful Indian tourists make their way here to enjoy the cool, fresh air.Before holidaymakers, though, it was the British who beat a retreat from the heat to Shimla the town was the Raj summer capital. Architectural relics from this period pepper it still, including a handful of Tudorbethan buildings. Most notable is the Viceregal Lodge on Observatory Hill where the partition agreement was drawn up, and the neo-Gothic Christ Church. Built in 1857, it stands out prominently on the ridge and looks like it would be equally at home in the Cotswolds."

It is 187 km from Calcutta and described as the ‘Brighton of the East’, it is best for a holiday. Digha has a low gradient with a shallow sand beach with gentle waves, that extends 7 kms in length.    In Digha, the sea starts about a mile away from the start of the beach.The scenic beauty of this place is charming and luring. The beach is girdled with casuarina plantations along the coast enhancing the beauty of this place. These trees apart from beautifying the sands also aid in reducing the erosion on the dunes.One can view both sunrise and sunset at Digha sea beach. The sunsets and sunrises reflecting off the salty waters of the Bay of Bengal are something straight off an artist’s easel. The sea at Digha is calm and shallow for about a mile from the beach making it quite safe for swimming."
